The\n`Signer` is responsible for taking a `Buffer` and returning an `Signature`.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Signer {\n  sign: (data: Buffer) => Promise<Signature>;\n}\n```\n\nThe returned `Signature` contains a signature and the public key which can be\nused to verify that signature -- the key may either take the form of a x509\ncertificate or public key.\n\n```typescript\ntype Signature = {\n  signature: Buffer;\n  key: KeyMaterial;\n};\n\ntype KeyMaterial =\n  | {\n      $case: 'x509Certificate';\n      certificate: string;\n    }\n  | {\n      $case: 'publicKey';\n      publicKey: string;\n      hint?: string;\n    };\n```\n\nThis package provides the [`FulcioSigner`](./src/signer/fulcio/index.ts)\nwhich implements the `Signer` interface and signs the artifact with an\nephemeral keypair. It will also retrieve an OIDC token from the configured\n`IdentityProvider` and then request a signing certificate from Fulcio which binds\nthe ephemeral key to the identity embedded in the token. This signing\ncertificate is returned as part of the `Signature`.\n\n### Witness\n\nThe `BundleBuilder` may also be configured with zero-or-more `Witness`\ninstances. Each `Witness` receives the artifact signature and the public key\nand returns an `VerificationMaterial` which represents some sort of\ncounter-signature for the artifact's signature.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Witness {\n  testify: (\n    signature: SignatureBundle,\n    publicKey: string\n  ) => Promise<VerificationMaterial>;\n}\n```\n\nThe returned `VerificationMaterial` may contain either Rekor transparency log\nentries or RFC3161 timestamps.\n\n```typescript\ntype VerificationMaterial = {\n  tlogEntries?: TransparencyLogEntry[];\n  rfc3161Timestamps?: RFC3161SignedTimestamp[];\n};\n```\n\nThe entries in the returned `VerificationMaterial` are automatically added to\nthe Sigstore `Bundle` by the `BundleBuilder`.\n\nThe package provides two different `Witness` implementations:\n\n- [`RekorWitness`](./src/witness/tlog/index.ts) - Adds an entry to the Rekor\n  transparency log and returns a `TransparencyLogEntry` to be included in the\n  `Bundle`\n- [`TSAWitness`](./src/witness/tsa/index.ts) - Requests an RFC3161 timestamp\n  over the artifact signature and returns an `RFC3161SignedTimestamp` to be\n  included in the `Bundle`\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```typescript\nconst {\n  CIContextProvider,\n  DSSEBundleBuilder,\n  FulcioSigner,\n  RekorWitness,\n  TSAWitness,\n} = require('@sigstore/sign');\n\n// Set-up the signer\nconst signer = new FulcioSigner({\n  fulcioBaseURL: 'https://fulcio.sigstore.dev',\n  identityProvider: new CIContextProvider('sigstore'),\n});\n\n// Set-up the witnesses\nconst rekorWitness = new RekorWitness({\n  rekorBaseURL: 'https://rekor.sigstore.dev',\n});\n\nconst tsaWitness = new TSAWitness({\n  tsaBaseURL: 'https://tsa.github.com',\n});\n\n// Instantiate a bundle builder\nconst bundler = new DSSEBundleBuilder({\n  signer,\n  witnesses: [rekorWitness, tsaWitness],\n});\n\n// Sign a thing\nconst artifact = {\n  type: 'text/plain',\n  data: Buffer.from('something to be signed'),\n};\nconst bundle = await bundler.create(artifact);\n```\n\n[1]: https://www.sigstore.dev\n[2]: https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio\n[3]: https://github.com/sigstore/rekor\n[4]: https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority\n[5]: https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs/blob/main/protos/sigstore_bundle.proto\n[6]: https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse\n[7]: https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs/blob/5ef54068bb534152474c5685f5cd248f38549fbd/protos/sigstore_bundle.proto#L80\n[8]: https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs/blob/5ef54068bb534152474c5685f5cd248f38549fbd/protos/sigstore_bundle.proto#L74\n",
