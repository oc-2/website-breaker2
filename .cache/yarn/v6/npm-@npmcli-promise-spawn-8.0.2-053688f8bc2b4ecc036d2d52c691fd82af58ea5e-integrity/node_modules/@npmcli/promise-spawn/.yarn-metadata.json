    "readme": "# @npmcli/promise-spawn\n\nSpawn processes the way the npm cli likes to do.  Give it some options,\nit'll give you a Promise that resolves or rejects based on the results of\nthe execution.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```js\nconst promiseSpawn = require('@npmcli/promise-spawn')\n\npromiseSpawn('ls', [ '-laF', 'some/dir/*.js' ], {\n  cwd: '/tmp/some/path', // defaults to process.cwd()\n  stdioString: true, // stdout/stderr as strings rather than buffers\n  stdio: 'pipe', // any node spawn stdio arg is valid here\n  // any other arguments to node child_process.spawn can go here as well,\n}, {\n  extra: 'things',\n  to: 'decorate',\n  the: 'result',\n}).then(result => {\n  // {code === 0, signal === null, stdout, stderr, and all the extras}\n  console.log('ok!', result)\n}).catch(er => {\n  // er has all the same properties as the result, set appropriately\n  console.error('failed!', er)\n})\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `promiseSpawn(cmd, args, opts, extra)` -> `Promise`\n\nRun the command, return a Promise that resolves/rejects based on the\nprocess result.\n\nResult or error will be decorated with the properties in the `extra`\nobject.  You can use this to attach some helpful info about _why_ the\ncommand is being run, if it makes sense for your use case.\n\nIf `stdio` is set to anything other than `'inherit'`, then the result/error\nwill be decorated with `stdout` and `stderr` values.  If `stdioString` is\nset to `true`, these will be strings.  Otherwise they will be Buffer\nobjects.\n\nReturned promise is decorated with the `stdin` stream if the process is set\nto pipe from `stdin`.  Writing to this stream writes to the `stdin` of the\nspawned process.\n\n#### Options\n\n- `stdioString` Boolean, default `true`.  Return stdout/stderr output as\n  strings rather than buffers.\n- `cwd` String, default `process.cwd()`.  Current working directory for\n  running the script.  Also the argument to `infer-owner` to determine\n  effective uid/gid when run as root on Unix systems.\n- `shell` Boolean or String. If false, no shell is used during spawn. If true,\n  the system default shell is used. If a String, that specific shell is used.\n  When a shell is used, the given command runs from within that shell by\n  concatenating the command and its escaped arguments and running the result.\n  This option is _not_ passed through to `child_process.spawn`.\n- Any other options for `child_process.spawn` can be passed as well.\n\n### `promiseSpawn.open(arg, opts, extra)` -> `Promise`\n\nUse the operating system to open `arg` with a default program. This is useful\nfor things like opening the user's default browser to a specific URL.\n\nDepending on the platform in use this will use `start` (win32), `open` (darwin)\nor `xdg-open` (everything else). In the case of Windows Subsystem for Linux we\nuse the default win32 behavior as it is much more predictable to open the arg\nusing the host operating system.\n\n#### Options\n\nOptions are identical to `promiseSpawn` except for the following:\n\n- `command` String, the command to use to open the file in question. Default is\n   one of `start`, `open` or `xdg-open` depending on platform in use.\n",
