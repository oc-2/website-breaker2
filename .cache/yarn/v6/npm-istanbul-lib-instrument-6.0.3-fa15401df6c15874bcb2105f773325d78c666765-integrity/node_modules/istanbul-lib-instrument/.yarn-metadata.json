The implementation is inspired\nby prior art by @dtinth as demonstrated in the `__coverage__` babel plugin.\n\nIt provides 2 \"modes\" of instrumentation.\n\n-   The old API that is mostly unchanged (except for incompatibilities noted) and\n    performs the instrumentation using babel as a library.\n\n-   A `programVisitor` function for the Babel AST that can be used by a Babel plugin\n    to emit instrumentation for ES6 code directly without any source map\n    processing. This is the preferred path for babel users. The Babel plugin is\n    called `babel-plugin-istanbul`.\n\nIncompatibilities and changes to instrumentation behavior can be found in\n[v0-changes.md](v0-changes.md).\n\n",
