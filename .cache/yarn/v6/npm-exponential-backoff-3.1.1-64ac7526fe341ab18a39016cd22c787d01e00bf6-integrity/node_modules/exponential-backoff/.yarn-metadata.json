    "readme": "# exponential-backoff\n\nA utility that allows retrying a function with an exponential delay between attempts.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm i exponential-backoff\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe `backOff<T>` function takes a promise-returning function to retry, and an optional `BackOffOptions` object. It returns a `Promise<T>`.\n\n```ts\nfunction backOff<T>(\n  request: () => Promise<T>,\n  options?: BackOffOptions\n): Promise<T>;\n```\n\nHere is an example retrying a function that calls a hypothetical weather endpoint:\n\n```js\nimport { backOff } from \"exponential-backoff\";\n\nfunction getWeather() {\n  return fetch(\"weather-endpoint\");\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n  try {\n    const response = await backOff(() => getWeather());\n    // process response\n  } catch (e) {\n    // handle error\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nMigrating across major versions? Here are our [breaking changes](https://github.com/coveo/exponential-backoff/tree/master/doc/migration-guide.md).\n\n### `BackOffOptions`\n\n- `delayFirstAttempt?: boolean`\n\n  Decides whether the `startingDelay` should be applied before the first call. If `false`, the first call will occur without a delay.\n\n  Default value is `false`.\n\n- `jitter?: JitterType | string`\n\n  Decides whether a [jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) should be applied to the delay. Possible values are `full` and `none`.\n\n  Default value is `none`.\n\n- `maxDelay?: number`\n\n  The maximum delay, in milliseconds, between two consecutive attempts.\n\n  Default value is `Infinity`.\n\n- `numOfAttempts?: number`\n\n  The maximum number of times to attempt the function.\n\n  Default value is `10`.\n\n  Minimum value is `1`.\n\n- `retry?: (e: any, attemptNumber: number) => boolean | Promise<boolean>`\n\n  The `retry` function can be used to run logic after every failed attempt (e.g. logging a message, assessing the last error, etc.). It is called with the last error and the upcoming attempt number. Returning `true` will retry the function as long as the `numOfAttempts` has not been exceeded. Returning `false` will end the execution.\n\n  Default value is a function that always returns `true`.\n\n- `startingDelay?: number`\n\n  The delay, in milliseconds, before executing the function for the first time.\n\n  Default value is `100` ms.\n\n- `timeMultiple?: number`\n\n  The `startingDelay` is multiplied by the `timeMultiple` to increase the delay between reattempts.\n\n  Default value is `2`.\n",
