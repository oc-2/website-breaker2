    "readme": "lz-string\n=========\nLZ-based compression algorithm for JavaScript\n\n## Warning (migrating from version 1.3.4 - nov 2014)\nFiles have changed locations and name since a recent release. The new release file is in `libs/lz-string.min.js` (or in `libs/lz-string.js` if you don't care for the minified version)\n\nSorry about the mess in other repos. This will not happen again.\n\n## Note on server side\n\nIf you are using one of the ports of lz-string to decode on the server what was encoded in the browser, you might want to use version 1.3.7 as the version 1.3.8 introduced a slight change in the encoding. While the JS versions are completely cross-compatible, the PHP, Go, ... versions might not be as forgiving.\n\n## Install via [npm](https://npmjs.org/)\n\n```shell\n$ npm install -g lz-string\n$ lz-string input.js > output.txt\n```\n\n## Home page\nHome page for this program with examples, documentation and a live demo: http://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html\n\n## Other languages\nThis lib has numerous ports to other languages, for server side processing, mostly. Here they are:\n\n\n* **Java:** [by Diogo Duailibe](https://github.com/diogoduailibe/lzstring4j)\n* **Java:** [by rufushuang, with base64 support and better performances](https://github.com/rufushuang/lz-string4java)\n* **C#:** [by Jawa-the-Hutt](https://github.com/jawa-the-hutt/lz-string-csharp)\n* **C#:** [by kreudom, another implementation in C#, more up to date](https://github.com/kreudom/lz-string-csharp)\n* **PHP:** [by nullpunkt](https://github.com/nullpunkt/lz-string-php)\n* **Python3:** [by eduardtomasek](https://github.com/eduardtomasek/lz-string-python)\n* **Another Python:** [by marcel-dancak](https://github.com/marcel-dancak/lz-string-python)\n* **Go** [I helped a friend to write a Go implementation of the decompression algorithm](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string-go)\n* **Go** [Austin wrote the decompression part as well](https://github.com/Lazarus/lz-string-go)\n* **Elixir** [by Michael Shapiro](https://github.com/koudelka/elixir-lz-string)\n* **C++/QT** [by AmiArt](https://github.com/AmiArt/qt-lzstring)\n* **C++** [by Andrey Krasnov, another implementation in C++11](https://github.com/andykras/lz-string-cpp)\n* **VB.NET** [by gsemac](https://github.com/gsemac/lz-string-vb)\n* **Salesforce Apex** (Java like language): [bilal did the port](https://github.com/bilalfastian/LZ4String)\n* **Kotlin:** [from Zen Liu](https://github.com/ZenLiuCN/lz-string4k)\n* **Dart:** [from skipness](https://github.com/skipness/lzstring-dart)\n* **Haxe:** [from markknol](https://github.com/markknol/hx-lzstring)\n* **Rust:** [from adumbidiot](https://github.com/adumbidiot/lz-str-rs)\n",
